Semantic tableaux are a relatively efficient method for deciding
satisfiability of logical formulas. This program accepts a formula in
propositional logic on standard input and prints whether or not the formula is
satisfiable. It also prints the constructed semantic tableau.

See the examples directory for examples of formula syntax.

The algorithm used here was adapted from the outline in Chapter 2 of
Mathematical Logic for Computer Science by Mordechai Ben-Ari.

Example usage:

$ ./dist/build/tabl/tabl < examples/ex2.formula
(p and (~q or ~p)) is satisfiable

[(p and (~q or ~p))] Sat
|
`- [p,(~q or ~p)] Sat
   |
   +- [p,~q] Sat
   |
   `- [p,~p] Unsat
